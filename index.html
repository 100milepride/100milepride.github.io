							<h4>About the Artist</h4>
							<p>From Miss Bliss:<br />
							<blockquote>From small town Napanee, ON, Leanna Bliss (A.K.A. Miss Bliss) found her place in the house music scene at a young age while 
								surrounding herself with local DJ talent and genuinely learning the genre of the house for what it is. Leanna is a proud Queer DJ 
								and has continuously tried to advocate for LGBTQ++ and queer performers to ensure equal opportunity and pay. She grew up as a competitive 
								dancer, and the musicality she gained from years of dancing has helped influence her path to become a DJ and made her an exciting 
								performer. In 2014, she appeared on the Western queer dance scene and carved a path with her music and event curation. Playing in 
								underground scenes to commercial places while holding residencies at The FreeHouse Saskatoon, Twisted Element Calgary, Blush Parties 
								in Regina, The Hookah Lounge in Regina, Q Nightclub in Regina and Banff Fairmont. Miss Bliss has rocked many stages at Pride Festivals 
								across western Canada and continues to bring smiles and electric beats to the crowd. While carefully considering her crowd, she stays 
								true to her uniqueness and unconventional style. She always tries to bring fresh beats to every atmosphere, with no sets ever the same, 
								ranging from banging house music to bass-driven tech house while mixing in other varieties such as the old 90&rsquo;s classics, vocal remixes 
								of the songs you know, and other forms of your favourite electronic music. She never forgets her roots while mixing new flavours and 
								feels and… oh, anything you can dance to. With music full of love and character, she hopes you will take this journey with her and fall
								 in love with the night together. It’s all about the vibes; when they are right, we can all create something amazing &lt;3. LET&rsquo;S DANCE, BABY &lt;3 xoxo.
